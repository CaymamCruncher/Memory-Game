# Memory Game by Hayden Tofts

### How to Play

Clicking on cards flips them over so you can see their unique symbol. There are
two of every card and your job is to find them and match them together. You can
only have 2 cards open at a time and if you waste too many moves you'll lose a
star. The goal is to match all the cards in the fastest time with the most stars.

### Helpful Tips

If you get off to a bad start press the restart button in the top right corner.
This will restart the game and randomize the cards again, but you will also
lose any cards you have matched.
